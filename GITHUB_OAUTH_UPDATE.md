# GitHub OAuth App Update Required

## Issue
Your GitHub OAuth app is currently configured for port 3002, but the application is now running on port 3000. This mismatch causes the 404 error after successful authentication.

## Fix Required
You need to update your GitHub OAuth app settings:

### Steps:
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on your OAuth app "Calculator Startsim.ai"
3. Update the following URLs:

**Current (Incorrect):**
- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3002`
- Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback/github`

**New (Correct):**
- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`

4. Click "Update application"

## Changes Made
I've already updated:
- ✅ NextAuth configuration to redirect to homepage after login (instead of non-existent `/login` page)
- ✅ Environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` set to `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ Database tables are properly configured for authentication
- ✅ Session provider is correctly set up in the layout

## Test After Update
1. Update your GitHub OAuth app settings as described above
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
4. Complete the OAuth flow
5. You should be redirected back to the homepage with your profile visible in the top-right corner

The authentication system is now properly configured and should work correctly once you update the GitHub OAuth app URLs.
